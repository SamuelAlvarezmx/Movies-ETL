# Movies-ETL

## Overview

This code was written to visualize ratings of movies and clean data that was obtained from different web pages: Wikipedia and Kaggle. The final goal of cleansing the data is to share this information with different members and create a hackathon in which participants can use our data and build their own queries and analysis.
