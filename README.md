# Movies-ETL

## Overview

This code was written to visualize ratings of movies and clean data that was obtained from different web pages: Wikipedia and Kaggle. The final goal of cleansing the data is to share this information with different members and create a hackathon in which participants can use our data and build their own queries and analysis. At the end we created two tables that people can work in in the hackathon, movies and ratings.


* Movies has 6,052 rows

* Ratings has a lot more to work with and might be fun how people can handle this table.
